# Django Login with expanded profile

Django by default includes a user model that's very useful but it's limited to a user and a password so it's better to add it a few attributes. [This tutorial](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2016/11/23/how-to-add-user-profile-to-django-admin.html) shows how to add them and I followed the instructions. Also to complement this project I also applied the authentication views shown in [another tutorial](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2016/06/27/how-to-use-djangos-built-in-login-system.html) to use the django login system from outside the admin panel on my own.

Later on, I'll add CSS to make it look pretty.
